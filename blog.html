                Ah, coffee, that sweet dark delicious drink which unites us all from different backgrounds, occupations and interests. It brings together both the officer and the criminal, the professor and the student, the boss and the employee. 

Coffee has been around for thousands of years, but it hasn’t been until recently that we’ve discovered just how many incredible benefits it actually has. Are you a coffee drinker? Then check out these six amazing health benefits you may not have known coffee had.</p>
        <h3>Coffee protects you from disease.</h3>
        <p>Recent studies have found that drinking coffee helps protect us from a variety of different diseases, such as type II diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, liver disease, Alzheimer’s disease, dementia and various types of cancers. Drinking coffee has even been shown to improve heart health. That’s one amazing drink, if you ask us.</p>
        <h3>Coffee is a source of antioxidants.</h3>
        <p>In the Western world, coffee is the greatest source of antioxidants in our diet. Coffee contains an enormous amount of antioxidants. While fruits and vegetables also contain antioxidants, our bodies absorb the most from coffee. In fact, a study by the Journal of Nutrition even showed most people get more antioxidants from coffee than fruits and vegetables… combined.</p>
        <h3>Coffee can reduce stress.</h3>
        <p>Researchers recently found even the smell of coffee can help reduce stress, especially that caused by sleep deprivation. A study involving rats at the Seoul National University found those exposed to the smell of coffee had changes in their brain proteins tied to stress. Which means we weren’t imagining it—coffee really does get us out of bed in the morning!</p>
        <h3>Coffee fights depression.</h3>
        <p>Not only does coffee make us happier; it also fights depression and reduces the risk of suicide. In one study by the National Institute of Health, participants who drank four or more cups of coffee per day were about 10% less likely to become depressed and have suicidal thoughts. And why does coffee make us so happy? We can thank the antioxidants for that! </p> 
        <h3>Coffee increases physical ability.</h3>   
        <p>Coffee has even been shown to improve athletic performance. Caffeine increases the number of fatty acids in the bloodstream, which in turn are absorbed by muscles and burned for fuel. This saves the body’s reserves of carbohydrates for later on, making coffee an excellent source of energy for endurance athletes. </p>
        <h3>Coffee helps you live longer.</h3> 
        <p>Wait, what? Coffee can actually make you live longer? Yep! Of course, with the number of diseases it prevents it definitely helps. However, one study from the National Institute of Health even found that drinking coffee lowered the risk of death in men by 20% and in women by 26% over a period of 18-24 years. Eternal life here we come!

 

            There’s no doubt about it, coffee has some great benefits, so test them out and stop in to your local café or restaurant for a delicious cup of joe. And remember: stay healthy, drink coffee.</p>
